# Assignment 4.
Here is the data used for Assignment 4 of the Coursera certification "Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python". 

The files [des.txt](https://github.com/losvaldote/MPS_for_homework_4/blob/main/des.txt), [dr7_lrg.txt](https://github.com/losvaldote/MPS_for_homework_4/blob/main/dr7_lrg.txt), [planck_EE.txt](https://github.com/losvaldote/MPS_for_homework_4/blob/main/planck_EE.txt), [planck_TT.txt](https://github.com/losvaldote/MPS_for_homework_4/blob/main/planck_TT.txt), [planck_phi_phi.txt](https://github.com/losvaldote/MPS_for_homework_4/blob/main/planck_phi_phi.txt) and [lya_data_2019.txt](https://github.com/losvaldote/MPS_for_homework_4/blob/main/lya_data_2019.txt) were obtained from a modified version of the [Julia Notebook](https://github.com/marius311/mpk_compilation) and represents the Mass Power Spectrum observations. See [arXiv:1905.08103](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08103) for details.

The file [LCDM_pk.dat](https://github.com/losvaldote/MPS_for_homework_4/blob/main/LCDM_pk.dat) repesents the theoretical model and was obtained with the [CLASS Code](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public). CLASS is a code used to study the Universe evolution. See [CLASS II](http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2933) for details.
